# VSCode Friendly Macros

Please use Now Extension for VSCode when using this Syntax Macros
They will act as 'snippets' in VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets

You can also nest snippets, for example the grwhile has a placeholder which is a prefix for other snippets tbl which is common tables, so once you TAB into that placeholder... you can then hit Ctrl+Space, and it will show available and once you tab out you are still in the originating snippet :P
