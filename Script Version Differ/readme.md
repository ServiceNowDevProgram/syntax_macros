# Script Version Differ

## Overview

The Script Version Differ is a tool designed to compare two versions of a script and highlight the differences between them. This can be extremely helpful for tracking changes, conducting code reviews, and ensuring version control in your ServiceNow scripts.


## Usage

1. **Input**: Paste the source code of the old script version into the "Old Script" text area and the source code of the new script version into the "New Script" text area.

2. **Comparison**: Click the "Compare" button to initiate the comparison process.

3. **Results**: The tool will display a visual diff highlighting the differences between the old and new script versions. Added lines will be in green, removed lines in red, and modified lines with a yellow background.

4. **Export**: You can export the diff results as a text file for documentation or code review purposes.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Script Version Differ:

### Example 1: Comparing Two ServiceNow Business Rules

Suppose you have two versions of a ServiceNow business rule (e.g., `business_rule_v1.js` and `business_rule_v2.js`) and you want to see the differences:

1. Paste the content of `business_rule_v1.js` into the "Old Script" text area.

2. Paste the content of `business_rule_v2.js` into the "New Script" text area.

3. Click "Compare" to see the differences between the two versions.

### Example 2: Code Review

As part of a code review process, you can use the Script Version Differ to review changes made by a colleague:

1. Paste the original script (before changes) into the "Old Script" text area.

2. Paste the modified script (after changes) into the "New Script" text area.

3. Click "Compare" to identify what lines were added, removed, or modified.
