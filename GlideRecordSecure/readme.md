This syntax macro provides a structured way to utilize the GlideRecordSecure class in ServiceNow for database operations. It enables developers to securely interact with records while ensuring that user permissions are respected. The macro includes key functionalities such as:

Initialization: Create a GlideRecordSecure object for a specified table, ensuring that only records accessible to the current user are processed.

Querying Records: Use methods like addQuery(), addEncodedQuery(), or get() to filter records based on specific conditions, allowing for precise data retrieval.

Updating Records: Employ methods such as setValue() and update() or updateMultiple() to modify existing records securely, ensuring that only authorized changes are made.

Inserting Records: Initialize new records with initialize() and insert them into the database using the insert() method, maintaining compliance with security protocols.

Deleting Records: Remove records safely using deleteRecord() or deleteMultiple(), ensuring that only permissible records are affected.

Logging and Feedback: Optionally include logging statements to provide feedback on operations performed, such as successful updates or errors encountered.

This macro serves as a comprehensive guide for developers to implement secure database interactions within ServiceNow applications, promoting best practices in data management and security.


GlideRecordSecure is a class in ServiceNow that extends the functionality of the standard GlideRecord class. It is specifically designed to enhance security when accessing and manipulating records in the ServiceNow database. Here are some key features and benefits of using GlideRecordSecure:

Security Context: GlideRecordSecure ensures that only records that the current user has permission to access are retrieved. This means that it automatically enforces security rules and access controls defined in the ServiceNow platform.

Data Integrity: By using GlideRecordSecure, developers can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, helping to maintain data integrity and compliance with security policies.

Standard Functions: It supports all the standard methods available in GlideRecord, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting records, while adding an additional layer of security.

Use Cases: GlideRecordSecure is particularly useful in scenarios where user roles and permissions are critical, such as in applications dealing with sensitive information or in multi-tenant environments.****
